<h1># Tezos Open Bond</h1>

<p>Bakerâ€™s scalability is heavily impacted by current self-bond ratio requirements. While many bakers have decided to resolve off-chain solution offering their customers to share the risk and rewards of the self-bond, we believe that these solutions lack transparency and traceability.</p>

We would like to develop a simple open-source smart-contract to offer any baker the possibility to increase their self-bond transparently. Ideally, we would also like to do formal verification on this smart-contract, ensuring a higher level of security for bakers and delegators. </p>

<b>Through this smart-contract, delegators will be able to:</b>

Take part in self-bond if they want to do so (vs simple delegation), face additional risks and earn additional rewards 
Leave the self-bond and get back their tokens </p>

<b>Through this smart-contract, bakers will be able to:</b>

Scale their business without having to acquire more Tezos and getting exposed to volatility
Offer a transparent solution to delegators wishing to be part of the self-bond
Call a function to take into account the new value of the pool

We plan to work with partners such as Octo Technology (smart contract development) and Nomadic Labs (formal verification) on this open-source community project.

<h3>How will this project impact the Tezos ecosystem?</h3>

<p>This project will enable more scalability for Tezos bakers and will greatly enhance the transparency of the ecosystem./p>

<h3>What is the market demand for your project?</h3>

462 bakers according to Tezos explorer, about 30 of these are over-delegated and could be interested in such a solution. However, we believe that the demand might be even higher since if the self-bond is scalable, the solution might attract (i) more new bakers and (ii) current bakers who wish to get less exposure to the price of Tezos

Utimate goal : Writing an original "inspired" tez-baking contract, potentially improved & open source.
